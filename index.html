      <p class="lead text-center">Mosaic - A tactile and meditative Art form accessible to all ...</p>
      <p class="text-center">
      During my workshops you can choose to come to an introduction to mosaic if you're a beginner; learn new techniques if you've made mosaics before; or delve deep into complex areas if you're a more advanced practitioner – all in a spirit of maximum freedom of choice.
      The emphasis is on minimal theory and maximum hands-on creation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
      After some initial tutoring on the techniques you will be thrown directly into your own creation. The classes are flexible and come in the form of either weekend group sessions (where you can come for 1 day or for the entire weekend), or one-to-one Master tutoring scheduled around
      a mutually suitable time during the week.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
      With all my classes, the day begins with a brief introduction on “How to create a mosaic design” followed by the stages of sculpting a tile into any shape of your choosing so your mosaic-making can evolve freely. I will then advise and guide you on your individual journey providing useful tips, insights and troubleshooting assistance from my years of experience.

            <p> Nathalie's teaching style is just perfect. In fact I would describe her style more that of an enthusiastic and incredibly experienced coach. Nathalie is quick to work alongside you embracing your ideas but giving them soul as well as body!
            Nathalies works are awesome and totally inspirational. To work in her studio surrounded by many of these works of art and with the creator herself was simply 'mind-blowing'. - Kathryn Price</p>
            <p>"So much for a wonderful, inspiring day. Brilliant, couldn't have been better"! - Jo Holborn</p>

            <p>"What a lovely way to spend a weekend - a nice group of people, a calm and relaxed atmosphere and such a generous array of beautiful materials to work with...and very nice lunches too! I must say it was the nicest workshop of any kind that I have been on. You are such a supportive teacher. We all came away with such fantastic pieces. My mosaic is now hanging in my bathroom and it looks great. You've given me the confidence to continue with more projects.
            Many, many thanks". - Ann-Marie Morgan</p>
            <p>"I really enjoyed the one-day mosaic workshop - it managed to be relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Nathalie is an excellent teacher who quickly assesses the people in her class and works to their individual strengths, making it a very enjoyable day for everyone. I'd highly recommend this workshop!" - Frances Hirst</p>
